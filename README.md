# Aaron Ross

Senior Software Engineer at [Great Expectations Labs](https://github.com/greatexpectationslabs) • Oregon, USA

I've been building web applications for almost 10 years across TypeScript, Python, Go, and whatever else the job calls for. Right now I split my time between data quality tooling at [Great Expectations Labs](https://github.com/greatexpectationslabs) and building products at [Anomalous Ventures](https://github.com/anomalousventures), my own shop where I work on civic tech, developer tools, and client projects.

Lately I've been writing a lot of Go + HTMX and using AI agents for most of my development. Still reach for TypeScript and React when they're the right tool.

Here's my [resume](https://ashmortar.github.io/resume/) if you want the full picture.

Also: HTMX, Templ, NestJS, Elixir (when the mood strikes), Neovim (extensively configured), and whatever else solves the problem.

## Notable Work

I contribute to [@great-expectations](https://github.com/great-expectations), an open-source data validation framework (11K+ stars on GitHub), and build applications for the GX Cloud platform at [@greatexpectationslabs](https://github.com/greatexpectationslabs).

Current live projects:
- [Democracy Direct](https://democracy-direct.com) - Privacy-first platform to find and contact your federal representatives, with fillable form letters and legislation search
- [Tracks](https://github.com/anomalousventures/tracks) - ⚡ Go, fast. A batteries-included toolkit for hypermedia servers [(docs here)](https://anomalousventures.github.io/tracks)

- [watchlist.fly.dev](https://watchlist.fly.dev) - Media tracking app

Side projects and experiments:
- [note-js](https://github.com/ashmortar/note-js) - A collaborative, local-first notebook editor for JavaScript/TypeScript (think Jupyter, but for JS)
- [go-watchlist](https://github.com/ashmortar/go-watchlist) - Rebuilt the watchlist app in Go + HTMX to learn both
- [eph](https://github.com/ephlabs/eph) - Ephemeral environments tool ("What the Eph?!")
