# Aaron Ross

Senior Software Engineer at [Great Expectations Labs](https://github.com/greatexpectationslabs) • Oregon, USA

I'm a full-stack engineer who builds applications and architects systems. Most of my day-to-day work happens in private repositories at Great Expectations Labs and [Anomalous Ventures](https://github.com/anomalousventures), where I'm building data quality tools and exploring what's possible when you let AI agents write most of your code.

These days I'm particularly interested in LLM integration, agent orchestration, and modern web architectures. I've been exploring Go for backend services and experimenting with hypermedia-driven approaches (HTMX + Templ). Still love TypeScript and React for the right problems.

![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Docker-2496ED?style=flat-square&logo=docker&logoColor=white)

Also: HTMX, Templ, NestJS, Elixir (when the mood strikes), Neovim (extensively configured), and whatever else solves the problem.

## Notable Work

I contribute to [@great-expectations](https://github.com/great-expectations), the leading open-source data validation framework (10K+ stars), and build applications for the GX Cloud platform at [@greatexpectationslabs](https://github.com/greatexpectationslabs).

Current live projects:
- [reserve-me.space](https://reserve-me.space) - Restaurant reservation platform (built almost entirely with AI agents as an experiment)
- [watchlist.fly.dev](https://watchlist.fly.dev) - Media tracking app

Side projects and experiments:
- [note-js](https://github.com/ashmortar/note-js) - A collaborative, local-first notebook editor for JavaScript/TypeScript (think Jupyter, but for JS)
- [go-watchlist](https://github.com/ashmortar/go-watchlist) - Rebuilt the watchlist app in Go + HTMX to learn both
- [eph](https://github.com/ephlabs/eph) - Ephemeral environments tool ("What the Eph?!")
- [dotfiles](https://github.com/ashmortar/dotfiles) - My Neovim config and development setup
